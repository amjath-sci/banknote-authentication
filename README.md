# Banknote Authentication Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on automating the detection of forged banknotes using Data Science and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to help banks reduce counterfeit currency circulation by building an accurate and efficient classification system.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used contains numerical features extracted from genuine and forged banknotes. These features include variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy of wavelet transformed images. The dataset is publicly available and contains labeled examples of genuine and forged banknotes.

## Methods
- Data exploration and visualization using heatmaps and pairplots to understand feature relationships.
- Preprocessing data and handling missing values (if any).
- Applying machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forest classifiers.
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results Summary
- The models achieved high accuracy in classifying forged vs genuine banknotes.
- Key features contributing to classification were identified.
- Visualization techniques provided insights into data distribution and feature correlations.
